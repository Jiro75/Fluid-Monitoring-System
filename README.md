# Fluid-Monitoring-System: A Creative Solution for Fluid Monitoring in Medical Care! 🎉
We've developed an innovative device using Arduino technology that automates the monitoring of IV fluid and catheter bag levels, enhancing patient safety and easing the workload for healthcare professionals.
Instead of using IR sensors, we've implemented water level sensors for more accurate and reliable fluid level detection. This allows for continuous monitoring with over 95% accuracy, automatic alerts when fluid levels reach critical thresholds, and easy data interpretation—even in the most stressful hospital conditions.
Our solution is:

### 💸 Cost-effective
Utilizing affordable Arduino components makes it accessible for a wide range of healthcare settings.

### 🤝 User-friendly
Designed with simplicity in mind so caregivers can focus on patients, not gadgets.

### 🛡️ Durable 
Built to withstand the demanding hospital environment for at least two years of continuous use.

### 📈 Scalable
Can be integrated into centralized hospital monitoring systems for real-time tracking across multiple patients.<br><br>

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- Water Level Sensor
- Buzzer
- Leds
- Jumper wires
- A Wooden stand for IV bags
